Everything is great, but nobody is happy.


Very often we look at the past so that we can understand the present. There was a time, long ago, and not so long ago, in which almost everything we take for granted today was much harder to obtain. Money, Health-Care, Friends, Sex, Entertainment… Freedom. Oppression and dictatorial governments dominated (still do ?) in several countries, people couldn’t freely express themselves in fear of being taken by “Them”. Those that did were called “subversives”. But “Them” covered the world in shadows born out of ignorance and delusions of grandeur…

And so it was that given that predicament, people those days had a lot to say. It was stuck in their throats. They felt repressed, chained. It appears that facing hardships brings out the best in people. Some of the best artists of all time, singers, writers, bands, poets, rockers, punks, subversives, fathers and mothers, etc, appeared at that time. People fought. People reacted in any way they could. They cried and laughed.

But those days are long gone. Today we live in the Age of Abundance. We have so much of everything (do we ?). We have too much of everything. There’s no limit. The more the better. There is no too much of anything. Have too much of anything and it will inevitably become banal. Of no importance.

Today we have Freedom (do we?). So where are our people ? Most singers have nothing of value to sing about, most “social influencers” have nothing of value to influence with. We had so much to do and say after we gain our freedom, but now we’re either mute or say too much. Famous or not we’re all artists once we express to the world who we really are. Don’t be afraid to express yourself to supplant a commercial demand. Do it now.

There’s too much sexualization. Yes, it’s true. Yes, sex was a taboo for so much time. People couldn’t express themselves with their bodies. And suddenly people could. But it was too much. Today the feminine, and masculine body is banalized, trivialized. We see too much of it in all media. As a result, people objectify the body. Trivialize it. Meanwhile, in another place women walk the streets covered from head to toe. If showing too much is a distorted behavior, so is covering it all.

How to escape that paradox ? The key is that we must stop idolizing the body. We are not our bodies. We inhabit them. We are our Minds, our Consciousness. Some say we’re a self-aware point of energy in space. We must not idolize and live to show off to others, but care and love our bodies and the bodies of others as a sacred dwelling. Our sacred temples.

True happiness comes from a fulfillment of the desires of our Hearts not our material desires. I said desires. Not needs. What do you really need? Stop to think. Who you are ? What defines you ? What motivates you ? What gives you purpose ? A reason of living ? That is who you are. If you live not being who you really are, you’ll be unhappy forever. If you don’t know who you are you’ll be forever unfulfilled.

Exercise your Will. The truth is that 99% of people live by the Truth of Others. We must all seek. We must all Be who we really are.

In the movie, “The Matrix”, by the way, a movie which reflects our Reality, or more precisely, our Illusion, the Architect, a figure which represents the Creator of everything there is, describes the First Matrix. A utopia in which everything was perfect and neatly controlled. Everything was done for you, arranged for you. It was a disaster. People rejected it and died by the millions. After that, learning with this failure, the Architect created a World in which people had the power of Choice and the duty to live its consequences, even if people were only aware of this power of Choice in a subconscious level. Only then things stabilized. Only 1% of people transcended this system.

Is the Matrix merely a fiction movie then ?

People have it all but nobody is happy. Maybe we’re missing it all ?.
