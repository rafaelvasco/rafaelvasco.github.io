When we are children we are like a blank canvas. Everything is new to us. The possibilities are endless. We can do anything. We have no doubts in our minds of that fact. All our reactions are absolutely genuine. There’s no memories to affect them and distort them. Because we have none.

As we get older, that mental canvas gets filled. So many things. So many experiences that we accumulate during our lives. Good and bad, we think. We look at this canvas and say: That is me. That is my Self.

That canvas is filled by memories. And then we lose ourselves in them. They are a Matrix that we stay the rest of our lives plugged into.

These memories control everything. They control who we think we are, what we think we can and can’t do.

How many times you got yourself saying: I can’t do this. This is too hard. I’m not smart enough. I’m too introverted for this. I’m too shy. Then life throws stones at you and you victimize yourself: I can’t take this anymore ! I can’t handle this ! All I want is an easy life. Everything must work for me not against me ! I can’t handle failure ! If I failed then it’s my fault because I’m not good enough !

You created a framework that defines yourself and that is set in stone, you think.

But that is a prison you imprisoned yourself into.

Human qualities are not set in stone. You are not X or Y or Z. You can be anything if you put your mind to it.

If you think a person is intelligent or successful in life. That they can solve hard problems. They put the work on it. They struggled. They persevered. They failed and kept going. They succeeded because they tackled hard problems all life, and weren’t afraid of failure against them. They felt motivated by challenges not oppressed by them. Most people give up at the first failure and move to something else. I’m not good at that. They think.

If you put in the action, the will that comes from the right mindset, you can do and be anything. Reprogram your mind.

That is the mindset.

Action. Effort. Discipline.

Throw away who you think you are. Renew who you are everyday. Don’t get stuck in an illusion that you think defines you. You can improve indefinitely. There’s no limit, only those that you put yourself.

Ask yourself daily. Who Am I ? Renew yourself everyday.

No one said it’s easy. By any means. But we all can do it.
