  alt: Mind Machine; A device that alters your brain frequency with light and sound patterns.
---

For this first review, I wanted to bring something that became invaluable in my life:
The Mind Machine. There's different variations of it on the internet, but it's not something
that you can easily find and buy. It's kind of niche. I guess only we "neuromancers" know that things
like this exist.

Basically, the Brain Machine, is a device that alters your brain frequency by executing a program of patterns of lights and sounds. This version that I got came disassembled, and I had to assemble it. Mostly lots of soldering. It's a programmable chip with a removable controller that has programmed in it the pattern of lights and sounds that the device emits during a certain time. In my case, 15 minutes.

You lay down and relax. Put it on. Put the headphones on. And press the power button. Boom. Two LED lights start flashing in your eyes at a high frequency. At the same time, a sound of the same frequency blasts into your ears. Only loud enough to not cause discomfort. A couple of seconds later, the pattern of lights and sounds changes to a different frequency. High-frequency. Mid-frequency, then low-frequency, then high-frequency again, and so on.

What happens physically to you is that your brain frequency changes. You slow down. The brain synchronizes with the patterns. And the lights. What I feel when I use this is a process of progressively getting more and more and more relaxed. It's like entering a deep slumber. But at the same time, it's different. It's better than simply taking a nap. You enter a very deep state of total mind and body relaxation. It's meditative. It's almost like a trance state. And then, at the deepest level, your brain is at a completely different frequency. Usually, we do not get into states like this in our daily lives. Not when we are awake. And not when we go to sleep. It's something different. Stronger.

_The Components_


When I first used it, I felt very bad. Felt sick. Like I used a bad dose of a drug. It took half an hour for me to get better. And then the next day, I used it again.

Bliss. It was like ascending to heaven. It's a blissfull, peaceful, and deeply relaxing experience. All anxiety, all bad emotions and all tiredness go away. If you're feeling anxious, it eliminates it. If you're feeling tired, you recover your energy. If you want to meditate, you reach much deeper levels than you usually do when meditating normally. This device is really a hidden treasure. If you get the chance to buy one, do it. It's part of my life now.
