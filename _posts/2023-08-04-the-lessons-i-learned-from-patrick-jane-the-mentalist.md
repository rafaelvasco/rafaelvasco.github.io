For me, The Mentalist is special particularly because of Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), in short, “PJ”’s behavior. It left a deep impression in me. It’s one of the best written, and acted, characters of all time. Mr. Simon Baker did the work of a lifetime. “PJ” as a person wasn’t perfect by any means. But I think he gave us some important lessons of behavior that can pass unnoticed by some. These are either things he did all the time or things that I was inspired to do after seeing his behavior:

- Don’t be sorry about yourself. Be confident. Don’t let yourself down. Doesn’t matter who you are, you can do something that will make a difference.

- Don’t fear to say what must be said if it will make a positive impact.

- Don’t fear to do what you really want to do because no one else ever did it or is doing it. Do it.

- Stop comparing yourself to others.

- When you enter a conversation, start by giving a genuine smile. Doesn’t matter the nature of the interaction: A stranger. A friend. A significant other. Everything will be greatly enhanced by that simple act.

- Related to the one above: Don’t fear to show your smile to others. People put too much shields between one another. Too much barriers. Express your feelings.

- Always be kind to everyone that deserves your kindness. Be kind to all animals and children.

- Don’t fear appearing childish to others. Express your feelings. Children are much wiser in that regard than adults. Be spontaneous. Be serious only when the situation asks for it.

- Take notice of the needs of others. And if you can do something about it, do it.

- Learn to cherish the simple things in life. All your essential needs are very simple to take care of.

- Stop seeking for meaningless needs.

- Learn to appreciate nature and how you’re more connected to it than you think.

- Be persistent. Accept that pain is necessary to accomplish anything. If you really want something don’t measure efforts to do it.

- There’s no such things as failure. It’s only a failure when you give up.

- Read lots of books. Enrich your world with the worlds of others.

- Learn to read the feelings of others by taking attention on them. When you talk to someone, focus 100% on him/her; Look the person in the eyes. And signalize to the person that you’re giving your complete attention. If the person is important to you, express it clearly;

- When talking in public. Don’t think about what others will think of you. Think about what you can give to them. How you can you make it worth their time. Put a loud enough, confident voice.

Funny ones:

- If you like Tea, you’re a gentleman and a scholar.

- Drink gallons of tea everyday.

- Enter peoples homes and go directly to their kitchen to make tea. Just check what herb it is first. You could have a wonderful trip. Who knows….

**Thank you Mr. Jane**.
