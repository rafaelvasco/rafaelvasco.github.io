In this post, I wanted to share some practices that I do daily that help the mind and body. It's very important that we listen to what our bodies ask of us and learn to act upon it properly. Here are some practices that make a difference:

**Chest Breath Hold**

Standing up with a straight spine, breathe in slowly, and at the same rate, raise your arms side by side in a T pose.
When your arms reach your chest level, bring your chest forward and your arms backwards and raise your head, looking up. All while holding the air. Count 5 seconds. Then, do the opposite movement. Breathe out slowly while lowering the arms at the same rate. Do the same again, this time for 10 seconds. Then 15 seconds. Then 20, then 25, and so on. Until you reach your maximum breath hold time.

**Recover the proper flow of blood in the body: Hatha Yoga**

To recover the proper flux of blood in your body after sitting for too long, for example:
With your legs straight, lower your body until you touch your fingers. Keep in that position while breathing. Ideally like the following image, but do it at your level:

Then, the cow pose. With both hands and feet on the floor, arching your spine down, bringing your head and lower back up:

From the last position, keeping feet and hands on the floor, raise your body like a pyramid, like so:

Then, with the full body on the floor, belly down, the snake pose:

For a final basic position, this time belly up, both hands and feet on the floor, arch your body upwards like a bow:

After these, you will feel much better. Like your internal energy is flowing perfectly again. Great for recovering the proper flow of blood and oxygenation in the body.

**Dream Yoga**

When going to sleep, especially when your body is more tired. Lay down, close your eyes. But do not blank your mind and await falling asleep, like usual. This time keep your mind alert. Visualize something. For example, visualize that you exit your body and walk along the room. Or visualize a ball of light irradiating light in your body. Try to visualize something that forces you to keep yourself present in the current context. If you just visualize that you are in a green setting you'll probably just fall asleep and maybe dream with that scenery. The idea here is to let the body fall asleep but keep the mind active in the present context. So it's important to visualize something happening in your room or in your house. Any number of things can happen when you do this. Try it and see for yourself! I had very interesting experiences.

**Breathing Exercices**

(Be careful with these. Listen to your body if you feel any discomfort. Stop immediatelly. Do the exercises gradually and let your body get used to them)

All sitting and with your spine straight:

1. Breathe in. Fill the lower part of your body first, then the chest. Hold the air and compress your chest inward. Keep that for 15 seconds. Breathe out. Repeat.

2. With your right hand, close your right nostril with your thumb. Breathe in through the left nostril. Close your left nostril with your middle finger. Release the air through the right nostril. Do the opposite now. Breath in through the right nostril while closing the left. And then breathe out through the left while closing the right. Always alternating sides.

3. Breathe in. But this time, instead of inflating the belly, inflate the chest and push the air out of the belly. So inflating the chest and deflating the belly. While holding the air, contract the pelvic floor muscle.

4. Two fast and short breaths. Two fast and short breath-outs. In in, out out, in in, out out. And so on.

5. Breathe in fully. Let the air out gently while almost closing your mouth and letting the air exit through the teeth, making a tssssss sound.

These are some very powerful exercises. Always pay attention to your body and feel free to experiment with them as you feel your body asking for it. And refraining from doing it if your body, as in, internal organs complain. It's okay if only your muscles complain. Always pay attention to your body.
