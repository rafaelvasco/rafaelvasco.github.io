Basically, we all have two aspects operating on our consciousness: An analytical, rational part that we use the most on our day-to-day activities. And an abstract, creative part that is always on, but it somewhat stays there on the background while our focus is mostly on the other side. Some people call this the left and right sides of the brain. It’s not exactly accurate to call it that but I can see how it can make things simpler to understand.

That creative part is incredibly powerful because it is actually our true Self. When we do any creative activity like painting, daydreaming (yeah day dreaming is actually a powerful thing), writing poetry for example, we activate that side. When we dream, the rational and analytical side gets mostly turned off and the creative part takes the reins. That is why most of the things that happen on our dreams might appear to not make any sense. It does total sense. Just not to our analytical, rational mind.

There’s a lot actually going on it this consciousness talk, and I’ll be writing more about that in later articles, but the idea of this one is to teach you how to use your abstract, creative consciousness to program your entire being so that you can manifest your wishes. There’s a lot being said about law of attraction but yeah it exists. It’s just not so simple as some people on the internet can make it appear.

**Here’s how the practice goes:**

Sit comfortably in any way you prefer. Either in a comfortable chair or in a Yoga pose.
Close your eyes and relax. Do a deep breath, and exhale slowly.
Now, while breathing normally and calmly, each time you inhale count up. Inhale, One, Exhale, Inhale, Two, Exhale and so on. Keep this until you feel completely and deeply relaxed. Almost at the threshold to sleep.
At that point picture in your mind what you want to manifest. Hold it there as much as you can. The more deeply relaxed and near to falling asleep you are, the easier it’s going to be to visualize. Hold that visualization as much as you can and want. Put emotion into it. Feel it manifesting. You need to be in touch with your emotions for it to work. Emotion is the key to the Door so to speak. If you feel you need to dive deeper into your creative mind, keep counting up. That’s all this is. A way to shut down your analytical mind a bit and dive deeper into your creative mind. That’s the key.
