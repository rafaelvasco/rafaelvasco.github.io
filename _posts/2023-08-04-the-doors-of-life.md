Life consists of endless doors. Opportunity doors. Every door you open triggers an effect, a result in your life, positive or negative. If we spend our entire lives without opening any doors, nothing positive and/or new will happen to us.

But what does it mean to open a door? The doors of opportunity are opened from actions we take, or thoughts we nurture in our minds.
The greater the potential of good, to bring something positive to our lives, the harder it is to open the door. In the sense that most of the time we have to leave our comfort zone to open it.

When we open an opportunity door, many times we also open a door of another person. That is, our decisions and attitudes can influence in a significant way, positively or negatively the lives of several people.
If you go and take the courage to talk out of the blue with someone, you opened a big opportunity door. It may be the start of a great friendship or the great love of a lifetime.

If you go and take the courage to apply for that job in the dream company that you always thought you would never get, you may win the vacancy, enter the company, conquer your dream job, get money, make friendships, find love etc. Opening a door triggers endless possibilities for new doors.

Likewise, if you leave everything behind and move to another country to start a new life, you just opened a gigantic new door of opportunity. God only knows the possibilities of new doors that this new life will bring.

At the heart of all this is man’s greatest mission on Earth: To experience life in the most diverse way possible and to extract wisdom from it. That is the main reason why we are here and why our Creator has given us free will.

So when the door presents itself before you, don’t be afraid. Open it. Fear and apprehension will always be there, don’t let them paralize you. If it seems that no door appears is because you are not looking enough. Move it. Look for situations that have more possibilities to bring you newdoors. The more doors you open the more doors will appear.

Love and Light to you all. We are ONE;
