At the root of all humanity's problems is the illusion of separation and individuality and an over focus on satisfying one's personal desires in detriment of everyone elses.

These are some harmful illusions that are at the root of all Humanity's suffering:

- "I am completely separated from you. There's no inherent connection between us."
- "What I  do doesn't affect anyone."
- "If I do harm someone, that doesn't affect me in the least, as I am here, you are there. We are separate."
- "I live only to satisfy my own desires. And I will do anything for them."

And the biggest one:

"My **relative** must be made **absolute** no matter what."

That's the most dangerous illusion.
