In this series I’ll start presenting my favorite wisdom pieces from Seth. Seth is a non-incarnate conscience ( we are incarnated consciences ) who was channeled by the psychic Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 — September 5, 1984) in a series of books that contain some of the most transcendental wisdom I’ve ever seen in any medium.

It doesn’t really matter whether you believe that we are individualized Minds “inside” bodies and not Bodies with Minds or not. Anyone can learn a lot from these pieces. They can, and do, alter our perceptions, completely.

There’s two concepts that are important to understand first: The Mind Frameworks. In the excerpts below, Seth speaks of the Framework 1 and Framework 2. The Framework 1 is the portion of your mind that is molded by your body senses, your memories, your conceptions, your assumptions. It is the one you use the most when operating in your day to day. Some call this, the Ego. It is what you erroneously think comprises the entirety of your identity.

Framework 2 is a lot harder to explain. Some call it the Sub-Consciousness. This portion of your mind is truly free. It isn’t impeded by your memories and programmings. There’s no laws. No assumptions. It is pure Creative Force. It contains your innermost desires, your creative visions.

Seth:
Now: In the most basic manner, each person and creature possesses faith, whatever its degree or nature. Without it there would be no family groups — animal or human — or civilizations or governments. It may seem that the retribution of law holds society together and keeps criminal elements down, for example, so that you have operating processes that insure more or less stable living conditions. The laws, however, are necessarily based upon man’s faith that those laws will be largely followed. Otherwise they would be useless.

You ‘go on faith’ that there will be a tomorrow. You operate on faith constantly, so that it becomes an almost invisible element in each life. It is the fiber behind all organizations and relationships, and it is based upon the innate, natural knowledge possessed by each creature — the knowledge the it springs from a sustaining source, that its birth is cushioned by all the resources of nature, and that nature itself is sustained by the greater source that gave it birth.

You cannot be alive without faith, yet faith can be distorted. There is faith in good, but there is also faith in ‘evil’. In usual terms, faith takes it for granted that a certain desired end will be achieved, even though the means may be unknown. In usual terms again, there is no direct evidence, otherwise you would have no need for faith.

When you fear that the worst will happen, you are often showing quite real faith, but in a backwards fashion. For with no direct evidence of disaster before your eyes, you heartily believe that it will occur. You have faith in it. That is, indeed, misplaced faith…

You must begin somewhere, so you state your purpose clearly in Framework 1. Then you have faith that the event will be brought to pass.

Your own creative abilities (Framework 2) are instantly mobilized in the proper direction. Your behavior in Framework 1 must automatically change. The ways and the means, however, cannot be questioned, for they will come from a greater source of knowledge than you consciously possess.

Someone, for example, may plan an airplane trip. Everything will be arranged, the last detail taken care of. The person may take great precautions to see that the plane is not missed. Persons may have been contacted to care for the house during the time of absence. Children may have been sent to camp, neighbors assigned to care for pets, and every logical situation cared for.

Let us say that this particular plane may well crash; and, in fact, does. After all of this person’s planning, hard work, and effort, at the last moment everything seems to go wrong. The children do not leave for camp in time. One of the animals runs away. A ticket is lost. Our individual comes down with indigestion or cold. Lo and behold, for while everything seems to be going so poorly, our friend’s life is being saved, for he missed his plane.

Later he wonders what happened, that his life was saved and his plans altered at the last moment. Our friend wanted to live and had faith the he would. In spite of all his conscious lack of knowledge, he was brought to operate according to the information available in Framework 2, though he was not aware of it. He lost his ticket — a stupid error, it seemed. The lives and events of all those connected with his trip — the neighbors, the children, and so forth — all of those issues were arranged in Framework 2, so that while the events seemed most unpleasant, they were highly beneficial.

Framework 2 contains all the dreams, plans, and thoughts of all human beings of any time. There, the spacious present is operative. There, it makes no difference if an undesirable condition has lasted a day or a lifetime. There, you are not impeded by the past.

If your beliefs in Framework 1 make you assign great power to the past, then you impede your progress. I have said many times that spontaneity knows its own order, and I am speaking of true spontaneity. I say this because often anger, for instance, may seen spontaneous — and may be — but it is more often the explosive, finally forced expression of reactions long withheld or repressed.

True spontaneity, however, comes directly from Framework 2, and behind it are endless patterns of orderliness and complexity that are beyond your conscious Framework 1 comprehension…

It is not simply that in Framework 2 there is no resistance to creative, fulfilling, natural, life-seeking desires, but that the medium of Framework 2 itself automatically adds its own magnification to them, so that once you get rolling, so to speak, the acceleration is spectacular, in whatever issue is involved…

Jane:
Not only were these ideas fascinating to Rob and me, but they presented a model of the Universe that was in direct contradiction to the official model of a meaningless cosmos, and a physical world in which each species fought against each other one in the struggle for survival. Seth had always stated that each act is meaningful, but with the Framework 1 and 2 material he seemed to be introducing a workable method to help us attract the events we wanted and avoid those we didn’t want.
