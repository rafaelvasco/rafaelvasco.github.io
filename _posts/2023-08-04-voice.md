... Far away, a whisper.
Dear wind what do you bring?
Longiness for nothing,
Memories of a tomorrow unseen.
Oh what is this,
Fire that burns silently.
A voice, a yearn, a bliss.
Whence it comes,
Dear wind?
Fades away the echo of loneliness,
For the whisper turns into voice.
The always discontent contentment,
Struggle, will, choice!!!
For the voice,
The voice is me.
