**Who Am I:**
{: .prompt-tip }

Rafael de Castro Mendes Vasco, Brazilian.

Neuromancer, Programmer, Musician, Writer.... Who Am I really?

Born in the distant past of 1987.

A guy that's very very curious about everything. I think too much so I have to release it.
Everything that comes from my mind, that I find valuable, that are part of my life, I'll put here.
Essays, Reviews, Programming, Software Engineering, Aliens, Psychic Powers. Things like that.
